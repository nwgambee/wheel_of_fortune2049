## Gameplay Instructions

The object of Wheel Of Fortune 2049 is to earn money by spinning the Wheel and solving a series of word puzzles on the Puzzle Board. The player with the most money after four rounds is the winner. At the beginning of each turn, contestants have three options: spin the wheel and call a consonant, buy a vowel for $100, or solve the puzzle. Each consonant is worth the cash value of the wedge the wheel lands on. Contestants can continue spinning the wheel until they miss a letter or spin a Bankrupt or Lose a Turn.
